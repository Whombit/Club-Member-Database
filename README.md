# Club-Member-Database
Database to create and store all members in my coding club

- What I Could Improve -

// 11/30/23 //

Right now I cant even run the damn project on my pc, I know it has no bugs but its bitching for some reason

Other than that, create a more... appealing UI. That and I can create a feature to display all of the members of the
coding club in a list. I could also add text to tell the user that theyve been added to the member list.
